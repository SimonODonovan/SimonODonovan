# Hi, I'm Simon! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
I love finding solutions!

With experience across both Software Development and Software QA, I pride myself on realizing, formulating and implementing quality, workeable solutions, whatever the current challenege.

When not developing software I can be found developing myself through jogging, meditation and yoga. Other passions of mine include riding motorcycles and playing or listening to RPGs.
